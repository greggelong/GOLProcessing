 golhex game of life on a hexagon grid but kinda' a cheat as I am still calculating living and dead cells based on a regular grid with each cell having eight neighbors and just displaying that same data on the hexagon.  to do this for real you would have to calculate with different rules and only using the 6 neighbors of the hexagon.
-------
 Added a version with the day and night rule.  randomly starts the world with a 50 percent chance of each cell being live or 33 percent chance 
 
 if 50 percent the structurs can be very long lived
